        <h1>Implied Odds Calculator</h1>
    
        <p>
            [(1/EQ) * C] - (P+C)<br>
            Where C is how much you have to call right this moment, P is the size of the pot after your opponent bets, 
            and Eq is how often you will improve to a winning hand vs. their betting range. 
            The answer is how much you need to win on future streets to offset getting immediately incorrect pot odds. 
            (Hint: if the resulting calculation is negative, it means you already have correct pot odds to continue.)
